[Version 1.2.7 Update]

Added:
- Added secure door types to some of the in-game doors. They can only be opened with an interaction by settlement members and do not automatically open when you walk into them

Fixed:
- RequireOwnerOnline option will no longer make settlers invincible if there's a team member that's not the owner online
- Fixed settlement menu not appearing when Hardened Settlements mod was loaded. Thanks Snoobinoob for the PR.
