[Version 1.2.5 Update]

Changes:
- Updated to latest game version - v0.23.0
- Removed adventures vs adventures AI changes | Reason: base game added it
- Villagers, as in settlers that live in villages not owned by any player, will now give a warning if you break something near them instead of immediately rushing you to make more player friendly
- Stealing from villages will make the nearby villagers or settlers shout that they are angry to give you a warning sign
- Normal, non-secure doors in settlements can now be interacted with by everyone in the game, no matter the relation to the settlement


Fixes:
- Removed some missed debug messages, again :')
- Optimized the refresh rate of room scans, so new room properties don't update faster than vanilla ones
- Fixed adventure party members not targeting other adventure party members, it should work now
- Fixed targeting issue for the requireOwnerOnline setting
